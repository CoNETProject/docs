# CoNET Chat developer guide

**Evidence level: Implemented capability.** This page is a developer how-to for **CoNET Chat** on Layer Minus. The envelopes, commands, and APIs match current Beamio / chat-sdk clients. It is not a claim that Chat is a finished replacement for mainstream messengers.

CoNET Chat is relationship-private communication infrastructure: wallet identity, zero-trust mailbox routing, encrypted application envelopes, and wallet-controlled encrypted history. Use it to add wallet-addressed communication **without** first building a centralized user-and-relationship database. Product thesis, Beamio integration, and maturity limits live on [CoNET Chat](../applications/depin-chat.md).

Public site: [https://gitbook.conet.network/l0/chat-developer-guide.html](https://gitbook.conet.network/l0/chat-developer-guide.html)

L0 only forwards OpenPGP by wallet / key ID. Chat is an **application composition**: user-PGP business envelopes, mailbox listen, dual receipts, presence, and an optional encrypted history track. SI primitives and reusable helpers live on the [SI developer guide](si-developer-guide.md). Developer-track index: [L0 development](../developers/l0.md).

Public packages: [CoNET-project/chat-sdk](https://github.com/CoNET-project/chat-sdk) · [`@conet.project/chat-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@conet.project/chat-sdk). Reference clients: SilentPassUI [`cashtree`](https://github.com/CoNET-project/SilentPassUI/tree/cashtree) (consumer) and [`cashtrees`](https://github.com/CoNET-project/SilentPassUI/tree/cashtrees) (merchant).

## What a Chat client must implement

| Step | Encrypt to | Transport |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Register user PGP + mailbox | — | `POST https://beamio.app/api/regiestChatRoute`, then confirm with AddressPGP `searchKey` |
| Send a message | Recipient **EOA user PGP** | `POST /post` to healthy entries **A ≠ B** |
| Listen | Own mailbox **B route PGP** | SSE via entry **C ≠ B**, preferred `command: "mailbox_listen"`; legacy `command: "mining"` + `listenKind: "chat"` remains supported |
| After inbound ingest | (1) **B route PGP** ACK · (2) sender user PGP receipt, then mailbox-work wrap `NoPush` to sender mailbox B | ACK and receipt both via entries ≠ B; HTTP still `{ data }` only. `NoPush` is **Chat/APNs only**. L0 duplex mailbox work must omit it; see [duplex-forward](duplex-forward.md) |
| Presence (green dot) | Contact mailbox **B route PGP** | `wallet_online_query` via **C ≠ B** |
| Optional recover history | — | Encrypted IPFS fragments + `ChatIndexRegistry` head pointer |

Do **not** encrypt business Chat to an AA Smart Wallet unless that AA has its own AddressPGP row. Do **not** take `search-users` `results[0]` as the gossip target (`CoNET` ≠ `CONET`).

## Identity

| Item | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| Protocol identity | **EOA** + user OpenPGP + mailbox route |
| User PGP `keyID` | Encryption **subkey**: `getKeyIDs()[1]`, uppercase hex |
| Mailbox | A Guardian node. Current register API field `routeKeyID` is that node’s **domain** |
| `@BeamioTag` | Discovery aid only. Resolve with **exact** username / `accountName` match, then use that EOA |
| Presence | Mailbox listen-pool via `wallet_online_query`. Ignore `searchKey.routeOnline` (SI no longer writes it) |
| Optional split | **Routing EOA** for AddressPGP + listen / ACK / presence; **sender / recipient EOA** only inside the encrypted envelope |

Current Beamio clients often use one EOA for all of the above. A new app can split them: register and listen with a routing wallet, encrypt to that row’s inbox user PGP, and put the product `from` / display wallet only in layer ②/③. Mailbox B then sees the routing EOA. Do not also write the product wallet into listen JSON or hop-sigs. See [Routing wallet versus sender / recipient wallets](wallet-address-p2p.md#routing-wallet-versus-sender--recipient-wallets).

Register and `searchKey` samples: [SI developer guide](si-developer-guide.md#sample-register-a-mailbox-route).

## Envelope layers

Live `sendMessage` signs the **inner application string** (`text`), then OpenPGP-encrypts a JSON envelope to the recipient user PGP.

```text
① application body
   plain text  — or —  typed JSON (receipt, POS permission, …)

② pending row  (what most clients put in envelope.text)
   { sendId, from: "me", text: <① as string>, createdAt }

③ outer envelope  (EIP-191)
   { timestamp, text: <JSON.stringify(②)>, from: <sender EOA>, signMessage }
   signMessage = wallet.signMessage(text)   // signs ②, not ③

④ OpenPGP
   encrypt base64(JSON.stringify(③)) to R userPublicKeyArmored

⑤ POST
   { data: <armor> } → several https://{domain}.conet.network/post  (A ≠ B)
   HTTP JSON is **only** `{ data }`. **Ordinary chat** posts the user-PGP armor
   directly (no mailbox-work `NoPush`) so an offline recipient can get a native
   badge. For a **sender receipt** only, wrap ④ as mailbox work
   `{ data: armor, NoPush: true }` encrypted to the **sender mailbox B** route PGP,
   then POST that outer armor. See [SI mailbox work](si-developer-guide.md#3-mailbox-work-envelope-mailbox-b-decrypts)
   and [Native push badge and `NoPush`](../applications/depin-chat.md#native-push-badge-and-nopush).
```

Inbound: decrypt with the recipient user PGP private key → parse ③ → `ethers.verifyMessage(text, signMessage)` must recover `from` → unwrap nested `text` for typed payloads.

POS terminal authorization nests another object inside ① (`type: "beamio_pos_terminal_permission_v1"`). Merchant OS must unwrap along `text` and put it on **Staff pending**, not Messages. See [CoNET Chat](../applications/depin-chat.md).

## Sample: send

Reuse `postArmor` / entry picking from the SI guide. This is the live Chat envelope.

```ts
import { createMessage, encrypt, enums, readKey } from 'openpgp'
import { ethers } from 'ethers'

export type ChatPendingRow = {
  sendId: string
  from: 'me'
  text: string
  createdAt: number
}

export async function sendChatMessage(opts: {
  wallet: ethers.Wallet
  recipientUserPublicKeyArmored: string
  mailboxDomain: string
  entryDomains: string[]
  body: string
  sendId?: string
}): Promise<{ ok: boolean; sendId: string }> {
  const sendId = opts.sendId ?? crypto.randomUUID()
  const pending: ChatPendingRow = {
    sendId,
    from: 'me',
    text: opts.body,
    createdAt: Date.now(),
  }
  const text = JSON.stringify(pending)
  const signMessage = await opts.wallet.signMessage(text)
  const envelope = {
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    text,
    from: opts.wallet.address,
    signMessage,
  }
  const pgpMsg = await createMessage({
    text: Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(envelope)).toString('base64'),
  })
  const armored = await encrypt({
    message: pgpMsg,
    encryptionKeys: await readKey({ armoredKey: opts.recipientUserPublicKeyArmored }),
    config: { preferredCompressionAlgorithm: enums.compression.zlib },
  })

  const targets = opts.entryDomains.filter((d) => d && d !== opts.mailboxDomain).slice(0, 4)
  const results = await Promise.all(
    targets.map(async (domain) => {
      const res = await fetch(`https://${domain}.conet.network/post`, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({ data: armored }),
      })
      return res.ok
    }),
  )
  return { ok: results.some(Boolean), sendId }
}
```

HTTP 200 on any entry means the armor was accepted for forward. It does **not** mean the recipient UI ingested it. Deduplicate inbound copies by `sendId` (several entries may deliver the same armor).

## Sample: listen

Chat listen is an SI **route command**, not user-PGP business. New clients
should use `mailbox_listen`, which accepts an opaque per-device `instanceId`.
Legacy clients must set `listenKind: "chat"` on `mining`. Full helper:
[SI developer guide](si-developer-guide.md#chat-mailbox-listen-listenkind-chat).

```ts
const command = {
  command: 'mailbox_listen',
  instanceId: crypto.randomUUID(),
  walletAddress: wallet.address,
  algorithm: 'aes-256-cbc',
  Securitykey: sessionKeyBase64,
}
// sign JSON.stringify(command); encrypt { message, signMessage } to own route PGP
// Encrypt to B route PGP; POST { data } to entry C ≠ mailbox B; read SSE.
// B fans out each saved armor to every healthy instance for this wallet.
```

| Frame | Treat as |
| --- | --- |
| Handshake / `{ status, epoch, … }` | Liveness. Ignore for Messages |
| OpenPGP armor (user-PGP) | Decrypt, verify, unwrap, then **dual receipts** |
| `udp_listen_attached` / UDP frames | Only if you implement UDP; not Chat bubbles |

Keep listen on a Worker. Reconnect with another random **C ≠ B** after idle or drop. Use a `setTimeout` chain after the previous attempt finishes.

| Client rule | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Start the ~12s `connect_timeout` **after** `fetch` | Wrap / `encrypt()` can burn the budget before C is even dialed |
| Emit `listening` only after `res.ok` **and** `res.body` | 404 / empty body is a failed peel hop, not a live mailbox |
| Exclude the failed `node.domain` on reconnect | One hung C should not be retried first |
| Do not let `history.load` starve listen on a single Worker thread | Recover can run before `activeClient` exists |

A peel-success SI log `forward <ip>` is the **client source IP**, not mailbox B. If C peels then throws on hop-sign (`Buffer.byteLength` / instance of `h`), **B is never dialed**. Switching C does not help until peelers return a UTF-8 armor string. See [Peel, hop-sig, and listen timeouts](peel-hop-listen.md).

## Sample: verify inbound

```ts
export function verifyChatEnvelope(plainUtf8: string): {
  from: string
  text: string
  timestamp: number
} | null {
  let env: { timestamp?: number; text?: string; from?: string; signMessage?: string }
  try {
    env = JSON.parse(plainUtf8)
  } catch {
    return null
  }
  if (!env.text || !env.from || !env.signMessage) return null
  let recovered: string
  try {
    recovered = ethers.verifyMessage(env.text, env.signMessage)
  } catch {
    return null
  }
  if (recovered.toLowerCase() !== env.from.toLowerCase()) return null
  return { from: env.from, text: env.text, timestamp: Number(env.timestamp) || 0 }
}

/** Walk nested `text` for typed application JSON. */
export function unwrapTextJson(displayText: unknown, max = 6): unknown {
  let cur = displayText
  for (let i = 0; i < max; i++) {
    if (typeof cur === 'string') {
      const t = cur.trim()
      if (!t) return null
      try {
        cur = JSON.parse(t)
        continue
      } catch {
        return cur
      }
    }
    if (cur && typeof cur === 'object' && typeof (cur as { text?: unknown }).text === 'string') {
      cur = (cur as { text: string }).text
      continue
    }
    return cur
  }
  return cur
}
```

After decrypt, if the Worker received armor, compute `armorHash = keccak256(utf8(fullArmor))` before discarding the armor string. You need it for the mailbox ACK.

## Dual receipts (required)

After a **business** message is ingested (verified, not a receipt, not POS-permission-only):

1. **Mailbox ACK** — SI command `gossip_delivery_ack` encrypted to **B route PGP**. Removes the matching offline store. Sample: [SI developer guide](si-developer-guide.md#mailbox-delivery-ack).
2. **Sender receipt** — ordinary Chat business envelope whose inner type is `beamio_chat_delivery_receipt_v1`, encrypted to the **original sender’s user PGP**, then wrapped as mailbox work `{ data: <user-PGP armor>, NoPush: true }` encrypted to the **sender’s mailbox B route PGP**. HTTP to the entry is still only `{ data }`. SDK: `sendMessage(..., { beamioNoPush: true })` (requires `to.routerArmoredPublicKey`).

```ts
export const CHAT_DELIVERY_RECEIPT_V1 = 'beamio_chat_delivery_receipt_v1' as const

export type ChatDeliveryReceiptV1 = {
  type: typeof CHAT_DELIVERY_RECEIPT_V1
  sendId: string
  armorHash?: string
  deliveredAt: number
  from: string
}

export function makeDeliveryReceipt(opts: {
  sendId: string
  fromEoa: string
  armorHash?: string
}): ChatDeliveryReceiptV1 {
  return {
    type: CHAT_DELIVERY_RECEIPT_V1,
    sendId: opts.sendId,
    armorHash: opts.armorHash,
    deliveredAt: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
    from: opts.fromEoa,
  }
}
```

Send that object as `pending.text` (JSON string) using the same `sendChatMessage` path, encrypting to the **sender** user PGP.

On the sender: unwrap inbound; if `type === beamio_chat_delivery_receipt_v1`, mark the existing outbound bubble `delivered` by `sendId`. **Do not** append a Messages row. **Do not** increment unread.

Mailbox stores ciphertext first (`saveLocal`), then best-effort SSE. Do not treat SSE `forWard SUCCESS` as “the user has the message.” On every durable chat save (SSE online or offline), CoNET-SI enqueues native push when the recipient EOA has a registered `pushDevice`; Beamio API no-ops if none. `NoPush` / `skipPush` frames never enter that queue. ACK removes offline armor; it does not gate whether push was sent.

## Presence

On entering the chat list:

1. Refresh route fields (`routersArmoreds` / route PGP) from `searchKey`. **Do not** copy `routeOnline` into the green dot.
2. For each contact that has a mailbox route, send `wallet_online_query` (SI guide sample).
3. Merge `online` only when `ok === true`. Failures keep the last trusted value.

Online means: that wallet is in **this mailbox’s** `livenessListeningPool` and the listen socket is not stale. It is not a chain write.

## Resolve `@BeamioTag`

```ts
type TagHit = { address: string; username?: string; accountName?: string }

export function pickExactBeamioTag(
  query: string,
  results: TagHit[],
  addressHint?: string,
): TagHit | null {
  const q = query.replace(/^@/, '')
  const exact = results.filter(
    (r) => r.username === q || r.accountName === q,
  )
  if (exact.length === 1) return exact[0]
  if (exact.length > 1 && addressHint) {
    const hint = addressHint.toLowerCase()
    const hit = exact.find((r) => r.address.toLowerCase() === hint)
    return hit ?? null
  }
  const ci = results.filter(
    (r) =>
      r.username?.toLowerCase() === q.toLowerCase() ||
      r.accountName?.toLowerCase() === q.toLowerCase(),
  )
  if (ci.length === 1) return ci[0]
  return null
}
```

Current discovery HTTP: `GET/POST` `https://beamio.app/api/search-users` (application API, not SI). If the exact match is ambiguous, **fail**. Never encrypt to `results[0]`.

## Typed payloads

| `type` | UI |
| --- | --- |
| (plain / no type) | Messages bubble |
| `beamio_chat_delivery_receipt_v1` | Update existing outbound `status → delivered` only |
| `beamio_pos_terminal_permission_v1` | Merchant **Staff → Pending terminal authorization** only. Requires `childBeamioTag`. Do not show as a chat JSON dump |

POS permission is still delivered as user-PGP Chat armor. Classification happens **after** verify + unwrap.

## Voice messages: `voice_message_v1`

Voice is an application payload carried by the same recipient-only Chat
envelope. It does not add an SI command, a plaintext HTTP field, or a mailbox
media API.

```json
{
  "type": "voice_message_v1",
  "fragmentHash": "0x<64 lowercase hex characters>",
  "key": "<base64 AES-256 key>",
  "iv": "<base64 12-byte nonce>",
  "mime": "audio/webm",
  "durationMs": 4200,
  "sizeBytes": 123456
}
```

The manifest above is an illustrative decrypted shape. In transit it is
inside the signed Chat application envelope and OpenPGP-encrypted to the
recipient's **user PGP**. The audio bytes are encrypted locally with
AES-256-GCM before upload. The random 256-bit AES key and 96-bit GCM nonce
are present only in the recipient-readable manifest; they must never be
placed in HTTP JSON, a route-key command, an IPFS filename, logs, or a
mailbox plaintext field.

The encrypted audio is stored as one IPFS fragment. Clients upload the
encoded fragment in sequential **512 KiB** chunks and finalize it with the
fragment hash. The gateway rejects objects beyond the **256 MiB** gateway
boundary; clients should reject an oversized recording before starting
capture or upload. The hash identifies the encrypted fragment, not the
plaintext recording.

The receiver verifies the Chat signature and manifest fields, downloads the
fragment through the existing IPFS gateway, and lets AES-GCM authentication
fail closed before creating an object URL. Playback is local: keep the
decrypted `Blob` and its `URL.createObjectURL()` only for the active message
view, revoke the object URL when playback/unmount ends, and never persist
decrypted audio or the object URL in Chat history. A failed download,
authentication, MIME parse, size, or duration check is an unavailable voice
message—not an empty or trusted replacement.

Voice-specific replay and integrity rules are application rules: bind the
payload to the Chat `sendId` (and, where the client supports it, a message
nonce/expiry), deduplicate before playback, verify the EIP-191 sender
signature, verify the fragment hash over the uploaded encoded ciphertext,
and rely on AES-GCM authentication before release to an audio decoder.
Neither an IPFS hash nor an HTTP 2xx is proof that a human heard the clip.

Privacy modes are product configuration, not SI commands. A client may offer
voice disabled, contacts-only, recipient-only delivery, recording-length and
size limits, upload through a selected entry set, and local-only retention
policy. These options must not weaken recipient user-PGP encryption or put
the AES key in a route-visible command. Applications should disclose that
mailbox/entry nodes can still observe ciphertext size, timing, fragment
arrival, and listen state; optional padding or delayed upload is a future
application mode, not a property of the current protocol.

## Encrypted history (optional second track)

L0 does not store Chat history. Apps that promise cross-device recover use:

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Registry (UUPS proxy) | [`ChatIndexRegistry`](https://mainnet.conet.network/address/0x1511Caa71081C84d8a591490D1b83879088EED72) `0x1511Caa71081C84d8a591490D1b83879088EED72` |
| Read pointer | RPC `getPointer(eoa)` on CoNET L1 (not Cluster-only) |
| Write pointer | EIP-712 `SetPointer` → Cluster `POST /api/setChatIndexPointer` (gas relay) |
| Fragments | `https://ipfs.conet.network/api/storageFragment` / `getFragment?hash=` |
| Hash | `keccak256(utf8(cipherB64))` |

Local `profile.chats` is the UI track. After recover it may be empty. Decrypt the index, **create missing sessions** by peer EOA, then merge. Do not `if (!chats.length) return`. POS permission and delivery receipts stay off the encrypted history track.

Keys are derived in a Worker from an EIP-191 domain over the EOA. Without the EOA signing key, history is unreadable. See the product page and chat-sdk `history` worker for the HKDF labels.

History synchronization is a union merge, not a length-based table replacement. Records are deduplicated by `sendId`, or by `cid` when no `sendId` exists, preserving unique appends from both devices. A conflicting `seq`/`cid` or `prevCid` fork is repaired by decrypting the records, ordering them by timestamp and `sendId`, re-encrypting them with a new linear chain, uploading the fragments, and publishing the new pointer. Network failure or an incomplete pull must preserve the trusted local mirror. The Worker serializes mutations and runs background `syncFromHead()` on a non-overlapping `setTimeout` chain, which is cleared when the Worker is destroyed; `setInterval` is not used.

## Using `@conet.project/chat-sdk`

Prefer the SDK Worker over copying OpenPGP onto the UI thread. Host responsibilities the SDK still expects:

- inject `eoa`, user PGP private/public, **own route public key**, and the Guardian node list;
- never send the EOA private key into a Worker if your product forbids it — current CoNET Chat Worker derives listen/send from material the host already holds; keep secrets out of logs either way;
- implement UI ingest: verify (if not already), classify typed payloads, dual receipts, create-session-on-recover;
- register coupon / tag / merchant data on your own stores; the SDK is the gossip plane.

If you hand-roll, keep the same A/B/C and envelope rules so mailboxes stay interoperable with Beamio clients.

## Diagnosis: “I sent but they never see it”

Walk this order. Do not skip to “the parser is broken.”

1. Recipient EOA equals the AddressPGP row you encrypted to (not AA, not a prefix-search collision). Never take `search-users` `results[0]`.
2. Recipient listen is up with `listenKind: "chat"` and SSE Connected. Epoch / listing heartbeats prove the pipe is alive; they are not inbound Chat. If the console shows only `[Gossip] Unknown format` and no message, the business armor never entered **this** mailbox — do not conclude “the parser is broken.”
3. If the Worker reports `connect_timeout` (~12s) and changing C still fails: check whether C **peeled** then threw on hop-sign (`string` / instance of `h`) and **never** `socketForward` to B. A log-only `uncaughtException` leaves the SSE open until the client timer. See [Peel, hop-sig, and listen timeouts](peel-hop-listen.md).
4. SI `forward <ip>` after peel is the **client source IP**, not mailbox B.
5. Mailbox logged `forWard SUCCESS` or `save to Local`. Offline users get a flush on next listen; the client must process that flush (do not skip the first SSE event) and dedupe `sendId`.
6. Fake-armor **404** is SI rejecting bad PGP, not a down node.
7. Sender used entries **A ≠ B**. Direct-to-B is not the product path.
8. Recipient `isMyRoute` / wallet↔route hash consistency can block listen and presence without blocking user-PGP store.

## Checklist

- [ ] Sender registered (`regiestChatRoute` + `searchKey` shows the local subkey)
- [ ] Business encrypt-to recipient **EOA user PGP**; listen/ACK/presence encrypt-to **route PGP**
- [ ] Listen includes `listenKind: "chat"` and **C ≠ B**
- [ ] `connect_timeout` starts after `fetch`; `listening` requires `res.ok` + body
- [ ] Peel / hop-sign failure is diagnosed before “switch C” or “parser broken”
- [ ] `@tag` resolution is exact; no `results[0]`
- [ ] Inbound verify recovers `from`; typed unwrap walks `text`
- [ ] Dual receipts after ingest; receipts and POS permission are not Messages rows
- [ ] Presence is `wallet_online_query`; failures do not clear a trusted green dot
- [ ] Recover creates missing sessions before merge
- [ ] No private keys, full private PGP, or `Securitykey` in logs
