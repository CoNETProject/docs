# Economics

The DLE design maintains three separate economic ledgers. They represent different liabilities and must not be collapsed into one fee balance.

## 1. Protocol value fee

The target variable protocol fee is **1 basis point** on applicable value movement:

\[
1\ \mathrm{bp} = 0.01\% = 0.0001
\]

- Asset transfers pay the fee in canonical conet-USDC after the required L1 pool/TWAP valuation.
- Trade settlement pays the fee in the seller’s selected `quoteAsset`.
- The fee is split 50% to the hosting archive group and 50% to the validator quorum credited for the finalized event.

This is protocol revenue. It is not an execution-gas deposit and is not assumed to fund fixed availability capacity.

## 2. Execution reserve

The execution reserve is a payer-capped canonical conet-USDC balance for objectively attributable work, including:

- L1 gas;
- oracle and proof verification;
- data-availability ingress;
- cross-domain settlement legs; and
- bounded retries allowed by `FeeScheduleV1`.

The reserve limits payer exposure before execution. Charges must be tied to the versioned schedule and measured work. Unused reserve is not silently converted into protocol revenue or archive funding.

## 3. Availability budget

The availability budget funds capacity that must be ready even when a tip has little transaction volume:

- five active archive voters;
- two ready standbys;
- validator capacity;
- retained history and availability service; and
- rotation, takeover, and re-home readiness.

The proposed sources are chain rent or creation reserves, with an explicit capped bootstrap subsidy if required. The availability budget is evaluated per epoch and separately from the 1 bp fee.

## Storage metering

Storage content, access, and retention use **GBToken (`GB`)** metering: the active 9-decimal CoNET ERC-20 at [`0xC3EF02DaE632b4C10abB66e07d92a387c10838D8`](https://mainnet.conet.network/token/0xC3EF02DaE632b4C10abB66e07d92a387c10838D8), not the deprecated `ConetGB1155` accounting track. Those charges do not become part of the conet-USDC protocol-value-fee ledger merely because the storage tip also uses archive capacity.

## Principal is not fee revenue

Asset-tip principal remains governed by exact-token conservation in the gateway specification. Burned principal, reserved replacement entitlement, execution reserve, and protocol fees are distinct accounting domains. No fee shortfall permits principal to be redirected.

## Evidence boundary

The economic model is a target protocol, not a report of current production revenue.

- The **100 USDC-equivalent asset-tip ceiling is frozen as a safety bound**.
- The 10-USDC minimum ingress value remains a pre-production calibration seed.
- Candidate 1.2× execution and availability coverage targets are not yet economically proven.
- Production asset ingress and new-chain admission remain disabled until an accepted measured `costEpoch`, complete branch benchmarks, and the specified 30-day 5+2 pilot close the evidence gap.

If measured costs exceed the profile’s safety envelope, the specified response is to pause admission or resize funded capacity—not to raise the frozen asset-tip ceiling without a protocol revision.
