# L2 — CoNET-DLE

**Evidence level: mixed.** The network identifiers and public services below describe the live DLE lab explorer and the deployed CoNET L1 routing facade. The rest of this section is a **normative design digest**. It is not evidence that the complete L2 system is deployed.

CoNET Distributed Ledger Expansion (**CoNET-DLE**) is a specified Layer-2-style architecture for many parallel, event-driven ledgers. Each ledger is a class-fixed state machine rather than a general-purpose VM.

This GitBook section is an **explanatory digest**. It does not create protocol requirements. Normative language and byte-level behavior are controlled by the English whitepaper and the three `DLE-*Spec.md` files listed in [Normative sources](specs-index.md).

## Network facts

| Field | Canonical value |
| --- | --- |
| EIP-155 Chain ID (CoNET-DLE Testnet) | **281669** (`0x44c45`) |
| User-visible Group ID (first group) | L1 bootstrap register tx `0x3076a806…6f2ad0` |
| Lab M6 second Group ID | L1 `registerLiveGroup` tx `0xf781f2c2…876d5153` (laboratory keccak aliases it) |
| Live archive groups \(G_e\) | **2** on `GET /health` (`liveGroupCount`) after lab M6 fission |
| L1 uint `groupId` (storage key) | bootstrap **1**; G2 **2** |
| Explorer | `https://dle.conet.network` |
| Archives | `https://dle.conet.network/archives` |
| Lab health | `https://dle.conet.network/health` |
| Lab RPC | `https://dle.conet.network/rpc` |
| Routing registry | `0x8B261eAECdFfeE9e7aC9fFe73386B0d6C9E76AfB` |
| Registry read RPC | `https://rpc1.conet.network` |

`0x44c45` is the **CoNET-DLE Testnet** EIP-155 chain id. It distinguishes this plane from CoNET L1 `224422` and Base `8453`. It is **not** Group ID. Do not add it to a wallet as if it were CoNET L1. `https://dle.conet.network` is the authorized explorer host; do not invent additional `dle.*` names, and do not write that hostname into Solidity.

The routing registry lives on CoNET L1. Bootstrap storage key `groupId = 1` holds seven distinct participant wallets. The user-visible **Group ID** is that group’s register tx hash. That is routing identity, not Archive Certificate and not 30-day qualification. See [Global Archive Routing Registry](routing-registry.md) and [DLE explorer](explorer.md).

## Status boundary

CoNET L1 is a live network. DLE is not documented here as a fully launched production system.

This digest was checked against the whitepaper revision dated **2026-08-18**. Lab M6 fission is a laboratory gather (`liveGroupCount: 2`); hosts emit the G2 L1 `registerLiveGroup` tx as the second Group ID. The repository honesty track (P12–P22) is engine + tests. **P23** keep-deploy evidence is landed as **6/7 `LIVE_OK`** plus fd-01 new-chain 409→accept; later fd-06 remap / inventory freeze / clock start are **not** P26. **P24** wires isolated `node.ts` to the same official-standby gate. **P25** lands Explorer **non-green** overlays. Home / archive-detail seating copy is **lab EIP-712**, never HMAC. The public SPA on [dle.conet.network](https://dle.conet.network/) now serves `index-C8IdTq4H.js` (2026-08-18T10:15:00Z; `explorer:test` 10/10). Clock started `2026-08-18T09:53:58.092Z` (`pilotQualified=false`). Home + Certificates show a **non-green** clock chip. It is **not** 30-day qualification. Next: 30-day wait / review. Do **not** invent P26. Review: [Lab honesty track](lab-honesty-track.md).

The source set includes frozen product decisions, executable vectors, a bounded formal-model result, and TypeScript archive reference work. It also records unresolved production gates. In particular:

- production asset ingress and new-chain admission remain disabled pending measured economic evidence;
- the archive conformance specification forbids production signing until its interoperability, wrapper, networking, and custody blockers close; and
- the DLE `AssetBurnMintGateway` is a target protocol component, not an alias for an already deployed Treasury contract.

“Frozen” therefore means **the referenced design or serialization rule is fixed for its stated version**. It does not mean the complete protocol has been deployed or independently verified in production.

For an ERC-20 issued on another chain, the target path has two separate state machines. An approved Treasury route first establishes the canonical CoNET L1 representation. A later DLE admission plus burn/activation protocol would establish L2 backing. A bridge transaction alone does not activate DLE.

## Protocol digest

The target design has six main parts:

1. **Parallel tips.** Each DLE chain advances independently. No event means no block.
2. **L1 birth certificate.** A chain is bound to a unique CoNET L1 NFT and exactly one class: asset, storage, or trade.
3. **EIP-155 Chain ID vs Group ID.** The plane’s unique EIP-155 id (testnet `0x44c45`) is what wallets and `eth_chainId` use. User-visible **Group ID** is that group’s L1 register tx hash. L1 `archiveGroupId[tokenId]` remains a uint storage key (bootstrap `1`). None of these is CoNET L1 `224422` or the tip NFT id (whitepaper §5.2.0d).
4. **Validator production.** A per-tip committee proposes event blocks; the current design uses seven selected validators and a five-signature threshold. Archives do not produce blocks.
5. **Archive finality.** The hosting archive group replays the candidate, checks data availability, and finalizes it through Tendermint-style prevote and precommit certificates. Clients route history from the L1 Global Archive Routing Registry, not from gossip or explorer hostnames.
6. **Separated economics.** Protocol value fees, execution reserves, and availability budgets are different ledgers with different liabilities.
