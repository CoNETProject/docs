# SilentPass VPN

**Maturity: Public application.** Public clients and node-side implementations exist. This label does not imply identical behavior on every platform, independent privacy certification, or a universal VPN replacement.

## Product role

SilentPass is a **privacy-oriented access product**. It captures traffic from a device or selected applications, authorizes access with a wallet, and uses Layer Minus to reach an egress node that opens an ordinary Internet connection.

It does not turn L0 into a universal VPN protocol and does not replace the Internet underlay. L0 remains a [PGP / wallet-address forwarding network](../l0/using-l0.md); SilentPass is one combination that asks an SI egress to open `host:port`:

- TCP/IP still carries traffic between clients, entries, nodes, egresses, and destinations.
- HTTPS/TLS between the application and destination remains responsible for end-to-end website security.
- Layer Minus supplies wallet-addressed control, entry routing, and a node path; it is not a new global IP network.
- Datagram-oriented applications require a separate UDP-forwarding path and should not be inferred from the TCP/SOCKS implementation.

Two product surfaces use this model:

| Surface | Application behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **SilentPass VPN** | A device tunnel captures eligible operating-system traffic and forwards supported flows through the SilentPass client. |
| **SilentPass Proxy** | A local SOCKS or HTTP proxy sends only configured applications through SilentPass. |

Use the VPN surface for device-level capture and the proxy surface for selective routing. Their capture boundaries differ; their Layer Minus dependency is shared.

SilentPass is **not** an L1 consensus overlay. Do not point `SaaS_Sock5` at geth `:8400` or beacon `:4200` and call that wallet-addressed L1 peering. That operator product is [conet-l0d](conet-l0d.md) (Under development).

## Protocol dependencies

| Dependency | Why SilentPass needs it |
| --- | --- |
| [TCP/IP](../l0/tcp-ip.md) | The actual network underlay and the egress-to-destination connection |
| **Wallet identity and OpenPGP** | Signs access commands and encrypts control data to the selected egress |
| **Layer Minus entry routing** | Accepts HTTP `/post` (HTTPS optional) at an entry that is distinct from the selected egress. The posted object is already encrypted; nodes route by OpenPGP key ID. |
| **CoNET-SI egress commands** | `SilentPass`, `SaaS_Sock5`, and `SaaS_Sock5_v2` validate admission and open a normal `host:port` connection |
| **Payment / admission state** | Lets an egress check whether a wallet is authorized to use the service |
| [UDP forward](../l0/udp-forward.md) | Separate capability for applications that require datagram-shaped frames |

The application must preserve the role separation: a client submits an encrypted command through an entry; it must not publish or treat the egress as a conventional, fixed “VPN server IP.”

## How protocol capability becomes access

For a supported TCP connection, the intended flow is:

```text
Application or OS
  │
  ├─ device tunnel, or
  └─ local SOCKS / HTTP proxy
  │
  ▼
SilentPass client
  │  select an entry and an egress for a new supported connection
  │  sign the command and encrypt it to the egress
  │  POST /post to the entry
  ▼
Layer Minus routing
  │
  ▼
CoNET-SI egress
  │  admission check
  └─ ordinary TCP connect(host, port) ──► destination
```

Current client code includes per-connection entry and egress selection. This can reduce reuse of one network path when an application opens separate connections. It must not be generalized into the claim that **every web resource always uses a different egress**: browser connection pooling, HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 multiplexing, caching, operating-system behavior, and platform-specific client implementations determine the actual granularity. That property requires runtime measurement for each client and workload.

The destination still receives a normal Internet connection from the egress. SilentPass changes the access path and identity model; it does not make destination protocols disappear.

| `https://vpn-beta.conet.network/` | Beta / test loader |

The source and public endpoints establish that the access product exists. They do not, by themselves, verify current store availability in every region, node capacity, path diversity, traffic-classification resistance, or behavior parity across all clients.

## What remains in development

- Measure and publish path-selection behavior under browser connection reuse, multiplexing, retries, and mobile background execution.
- Continue cross-platform feature and security parity work across the VPN and proxy clients.
- Harden failure handling for unavailable entries, unavailable egresses, interrupted streams, and admission-service failures.
- Define and test the supported UDP and real-time application envelope rather than describing TCP/SOCKS as a complete substitute.
- Publish independent security and privacy assessments for the clients, node commands, key handling, and traffic-analysis claims.
- Document capacity, latency, observability, abuse handling, and operational service objectives with measured data.

## Trust and security boundary

SilentPass reduces some direct relationships, but it does not remove trust or metadata.

| Participant | What it can observe or affect |
| --- | --- |
| **Entry** | Client network address, timing, volume, and routing-visible ciphertext metadata; it can drop or delay traffic |
| **Intermediate Layer Minus nodes** | Routing metadata and ciphertext needed for forwarding; they can disrupt availability |
| **Egress** | Destination `host:port`, timing, volume, and the client wallet information required by admission; for HTTPS, destination content remains protected by application TLS |
| **Destination** | Egress IP plus normal application identifiers such as cookies, logins, browser fingerprints, and request content |
| **Payment / chain observers** | Public wallet activity and timing that may be correlated with service use |
| **Client device** | Plaintext before encryption and after decryption; compromise of the device defeats network-path protections |

Important limits:

- Wallet identity is pseudonymous, not automatically unlinkable.
- Rotating paths does not defeat cookies, account logins, browser fingerprinting, malware, or endpoint compromise.
- A global observer that can correlate all entries and egresses is outside this product claim.
- An egress can refuse service, censor destinations, or provide poor performance.
- HTTPS-shaped transport should not be described as guaranteed indistinguishability from all Web traffic.
- The accurate product claim is privacy-oriented access with a different routing and identity model, not absolute anonymity.
