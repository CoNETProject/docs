# L1 — CoNET Blockchain

**Evidence level: Production reference.** The network identifiers and public services below describe the active CoNET L1. Individual contracts and indexed Explorer views still require address-specific verification.

CoNET L1 is an EVM-compatible proof-of-stake network. It provides the canonical settlement, asset, identity, registry, and cross-chain Treasury layer used by CoNET protocols.

EVM compatibility means that the chain executes Ethereum-style smart-contract bytecode and supports familiar account, signature, ABI, and JSON-RPC tooling. It does **not** mean that CoNET shares Ethereum or Base state, validators, balances, or finality.

## Network facts

| Field | Canonical value |
| --- | --- |
| `chainId` | **224422** (`0x36ca6`) |
| Native gas asset | **CNET** |
| Primary RPC | `https://rpc1.conet.network` |
| Backup RPC | `https://publicrpc.conet.network` |
| Explorer | `https://mainnet.conet.network` |
| Explorer alias | `https://scan.conet.network` |

`https://rpc.conet.network` is deprecated. It has returned state from an out-of-sync or divergent chain tip and must not be used as a source of truth, even if it reports `chainId 224422`.

## Two node roles

CoNET documentation uses two distinct node terms:

- **L1 validators** participate in proof-of-stake consensus and determine the canonical L1 chain. Their consensus-layer identity is a Beacon / Prysm `validator_index` (already observed **≥ 2000**). Do not use `ValidatorDepositRedeem.totalStakedValidatorCount()` as that census.
- **Guardian Nodes** belong to the DePIN service plane of the [Layer Minus cloud](../l0/permissionless-cloud.md). They may offer routing, mailbox delivery, bandwidth, storage, and CPU / GPU work. A listed Guardian is **not** a trusted host and is **not** an L1 validator. The registry snapshot near **472** is the **L0** scale.

Network-layer privacy and censorship resistance are transport objectives. Wallet-address routing and DePIN overlays can reduce dependence on directly exposed service endpoints, but they are **not a consensus algorithm called “stealth consensus.”** L1 consensus remains proof of stake.
