# Decentralized cross-chain Treasury

**Evidence level: mixed.** The deployed `TreasuryBridgeV3` proxy and its canonical CoNET assets are production references. The bridge policy, quorum, and replay controls are implemented capabilities. The hand-off from a bridged asset into CoNET-DLE remains a normative design and is not a production L2 service.

## Purpose

An ERC-20 issued on another chain is not automatically a CoNET asset. Its source-chain contract, supply, decimals, finality, and custody model all belong to a different trust domain.

The CoNET Treasury provides an explicit cross-chain boundary:

1. an approved route locks or burns value on the source chain;
2. a miner quorum attests one exact operation;
3. the destination Treasury mints or releases the configured asset representation once; and
4. CoNET applications use the resulting canonical CoNET ERC-20.

This separates asset custody and supply conservation from relaying. A relayer can carry evidence, but it does not receive an unrestricted right to mint.

## Production anchors

There is **one** production Treasury: `TreasuryBridgeV3`. Older CREATE2 / `BaseTreasury` / `ConetTreasury` addresses are deprecated and must not be documented as a second Treasury.

| Component | Address | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **TreasuryBridgeV3 proxy** | [`0xa208982212978550594A7FEEB70a61665d129003`](https://mainnet.conet.network/address/0xa208982212978550594A7FEEB70a61665d129003) | Sole Treasury: route policy, quorum, mint, burn, lock, and release on CoNET and Base |
| **ConetTreasuryPeer v4** | [`0x6093871d8a3EE6EaADc9869451D1693973cFBCC0`](https://mainnet.conet.network/address/0x6093871d8a3EE6EaADc9869451D1693973cFBCC0) | Peer module for registered burn/mint and configured swaps — **not** a second Treasury |
| **conet-USDC** | [`0x5209865D404aA5646eDe5B91CD4218909eA72eDA`](https://mainnet.conet.network/token/0x5209865D404aA5646eDe5B91CD4218909eA72eDA) | Treasury-canonical six-decimal settlement asset |
| **GBToken (`GB`)** | [`0xC3EF02DaE632b4C10abB66e07d92a387c10838D8`](https://mainnet.conet.network/token/0xC3EF02DaE632b4C10abB66e07d92a387c10838D8) | Active nine-decimal DePIN service asset |
| **Base USDC** | [`0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913`](https://basescan.org/token/0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913) | Current source-chain USDC for LockMint and product top-up paths |

`TreasuryBridgeV3` is an ERC-1967/UUPS proxy. Its stable address does not imply immutable logic: upgrade authority, miner-roster administration, route configuration, and token roles remain part of the trust and governance boundary.

The current production counterpart chain is **Base (`chainId` 8453)**. That is a governed CoNET ↔ Base route on the **same** V3 Treasury, not a permissionless bridge and not a second Treasury contract. `ConetTreasuryPeer` bytecode is present on CoNET L1 at the address above; do not assume the same Peer address is deployed on Base without checking `eth_getCode`.

## Three explicit route modes

Every route binds the source chain, source Treasury, source asset, destination asset, mode, decimals, enabled state, and policy version.

| Mode | Source-side action | Destination-side action | Typical use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **BurnMint** | Burn an authorized source representation | Mint the configured destination representation | Canonical assets whose supply can be reduced on the source chain |
| **LockMint** | Lock the source asset in Treasury custody | Mint a representation on the destination chain | Foreign assets that cannot be burned by the bridge |
| **BurnRelease** | Burn the destination representation | Release previously locked source assets | Reverse leg of a lock-and-mint route |

A token address supplied by a caller does not create a route. The route must already be configured and enabled, and the Treasury must hold the required mint, burn, or custody authority.

## Miner-governed operation flow

```text
user-authorized source operation
        │
        ▼
configured Treasury route
        │  emits one operationId-bound payload
        ▼
independent source observation
        │
        ▼
destination miner votes / sorted attestations
        │  threshold = ceil(2N / 3)
        ▼
execute exactly once
        │
        ├── mint configured destination asset
        └── or release configured reserve
```

The operation identity commits to the source and destination chains, Treasuries and assets, route mode, beneficiaries, exact amounts, source transaction hash, nonce, fee, and optional callback. The destination contract:

- rejects a route that is not enabled;
- rejects conflicting payloads for the same operation;
- accepts at most one vote per miner;
- requires the configured quorum;
- verifies that beneficiary amounts sum to the gross amount; and
- consumes `operationExecuted[operationId]` before distribution, preventing replay.

These controls decentralize authorization across the configured miner set. They do not prove that every miner is operationally independent, that source-chain finality cannot reorganize, or that governance and upgrade keys cannot be compromised.

## Onboarding an ERC-20 from another chain

The architecture can admit ERC-20s from supported chains, but admission is **policy-driven, not automatic**, and **not permissionless**. A caller-supplied token address does not create a route. Current product paths use pre-registered assets such as Base USDC, conet-USDC, GB, and B-Unit. A route needs all of the following:

1. **Source identity** — exact source `chainId`, token contract, decimals, and finality policy.
2. **Custody mode** — `LockMint`, `BurnMint`, and any reverse `BurnRelease` path must conserve exact raw token units.
3. **Canonical CoNET representation** — a stable CoNET token address with bounded mint/burn roles and a documented upgrade policy.
4. **Treasury policy** — the exact route and version must be approved and enabled by the configured governance path.
5. **Replay domain** — operation IDs, nonces, source transaction hashes, and destination execution state must be unique.
6. **Relayer and miner availability** — enough independent observers must verify source finality and reach destination quorum.
7. **Exit capacity** — a lock route must retain reserves; a burn/mint route must preserve replacement authority and supply accounting.
8. **Application admission** — wallets, explorers, indexers, and applications must recognize the canonical CoNET address rather than the foreign address.

Until those conditions are met, “bridging any ERC-20 to CoNET” is not a safe or supported operation.

## From a bridged ERC-20 to CoNET-DLE

The intended user journey is:

```text
ERC-20 on a supported external chain
        │
        │ configured Treasury operation
        ▼
Treasury-canonical ERC-20 on CoNET L1
        │
        ├── usable by enabled CoNET L1 applications
        │
        └── optional DLE admission
                 │ exact proxy/version
                 │ approved pool + TWAP adapter
                 │ minimum liquidity + fresh quote
                 │ AssetAdmissionRegistry = ACTIVE
                 │ AssetBurnMintGateway safety gates
                 ▼
          parallel DLE asset tips
```

The first transition is a cross-chain Treasury operation. The second is a separate L1-to-L2 admission and burn/activation protocol. They use different operation IDs, fees, finality rules, and failure recovery.

Once a CoNET representation has passed the future DLE admission gates, the target architecture can give it access to:

- event-driven asset ledgers that progress independently;
- parallel capacity across archive shards rather than one global application queue;
- value-bounded asset tips with a frozen 100-USDC-equivalent per-tip safety ceiling;
- wallet-addressed L0 coordination for private order and notification traffic; and
- class-specific settlement, including future miner-assisted markets.

**This DLE transition is not live today.** Bridging into CoNET L1 does not by itself create an asset tip, activate L2 backing, or prove that the required pool, oracle, gateway, archive, and economic release gates have passed.

## Security boundary

| Risk | Required control |
| --- | --- |
| Unauthorized mint | Explicit route policy, bounded token roles, quorum verification, and single-use operation IDs |
| Double execution | Destination replay protection and payload-hash equality |
| Source-chain reorganization | Route-specific finality depth before miner attestation |
| Reserve shortfall | Verifiable locked reserves or replacement-capacity accounting |
| Decimal or asset mismatch | Exact raw-unit accounting and route-bound source/destination addresses |
| Miner collusion or censorship | Independent operators, transparent roster and quorum, monitoring, dispute and recovery procedures |
| Upgrade or owner compromise | Governed upgrades, delayed administration, key isolation, public verification, and emergency controls |
| Oracle or liquidity failure | No DLE admission without a versioned pool/TWAP adapter, minimum liquidity, and fresh observations |

No bridge can remove all cross-chain trust. CoNET's design makes route authority, operation data, quorum, and replay state explicit so they can be verified and constrained.

## DLE maturity boundary

The deployed Treasury primitives are necessary but not sufficient for production DLE asset ingress. The DLE specification additionally requires a dedicated `AssetBurnMintGateway`, replacement-capacity reservation, pending-burn activation or refund, normal and challenged exits, cumulative conservation accounting, and formal release gates.

See [Cross-chain assets in CoNET-DLE](../l2/cross-chain-assets.md) for that second boundary.
