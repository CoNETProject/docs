# L1 decentralization and verifiability

**Evidence level: Production reference.** The measurements on this page are live contract views and Explorer facts. They describe what an outsider can reproduce today. They are not a claim that CoNET L1 is maximally decentralized, that unique addresses are independent operators, or that a running network is automatically a diverse one.

A live chain is evidence of **operation**. Decentralization requires additional public facts: who may join, who may change protocol state, how stake and geography concentrate, and which clients actually produce blocks.

**Network identity vs consensus census:** Beacon indexes past **2000** show registry allocation. They do **not** mean “2000+ validators already gossip only over wallet-addressed L0.” The destination architecture for L1 peer transport is described in [Run an L1 node — Vision](../developers/l1-node.md#vision-wallet-addressed-consensus-transport). Overlay maturity remains separate from validator-count evidence.

## What this page does and does not measure

| Question | What is published here | What is not inferred |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Is L1 running? | Yes. Explorer reports continuous block production on `chainId` **224422**. | Continuous blocks do not prove operator independence. |
| Has the Beacon / Prysm validator registry issued indexes past 2000? | Yes. [CoNET block 169843](https://mainnet.conet.network/block/169843) withdrawals include `validator_index` **2000** (and neighboring indexes **1987–2002**). | An issued index is not a current active-set census. Exited keys keep their index. |
| How many validators does this `ValidatorDepositRedeem` currently count? | `totalStakedValidatorCount()` | That view is **not** the Prysm Beacon active set and **not** the L0 Guardian census. |
| How is that VDR unit sized? | Each VDR-counted record is **32 CNET** (`VALIDATOR_STAKE_WEI`). | Uniform per-record stake does not prove independent operators. |
| How many L0 Guardian / DePIN nodes are registered? | `GuardianNodesInfoV6.getAllNodes` length and `getUniqueOwnerCount()` | A unique owner address is not a unique legal or infrastructure operator. This is the **L0** scale, not the L1 consensus set. |
| Where are Guardians labeled? | `getAllRegions()` and `getRegionNodes(region)` | Region labels are registry strings, not ASN, hosting, or jurisdiction proofs. |
| Which clients produce blocks? | The documented production stack is **Geth + Prysm**. | No public client-diversity census (Lighthouse, Teku, Nethermind, Reth, and so on) is published for this chain. |
| Who governs mutations? | Guardian writes are `adminList`-gated. ValidatorDepositRedeem is a UUPS proxy with admin-gated upgrades. Treasury miner quorum is a separate owner-managed set. | There is no published token-vote or DAO that elects L1 validators. |

Do not collapse these ledgers:

- **Beacon / Prysm validator indexes** — consensus-layer registry identities. Indexes past **2000** already appear in Explorer withdrawals.
- **VDR staked records** — validators funded and bound through this version of `ValidatorDepositRedeem.fundAndDepositValidators`. The snapshot value **475** is this ledger, not the Beacon set.
- **Guardian Nodes (L0 DePIN)** — registry IPs / owners. The snapshot value **472** is this L0 scale.
- **Runtime miners / SI listeners** — currently reachable DePIN service processes.
- **Treasury miners** — the allowlisted set that votes on TreasuryBridgeV3 operations.

## Observed snapshot

The following values were read from `https://rpc1.conet.network` at **2026-08-14T04:16:17Z**, CoNET L1 block **831043**. Re-read the same views for a current figure. Do not treat this table as a constant.

| Measurement | Value | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Explorer average block time | 6.0 s | `GET https://mainnet.conet.network/api/v2/stats` |
| Beacon validator index already observed | **≥ 2000** | [Block 169843](https://mainnet.conet.network/block/169843) withdrawals: `validator_index` **1987–2002** |
| VDR-managed staked records | **475** | `ValidatorDepositRedeem.totalStakedValidatorCount()` |
| VDR deposit unit | **32 CNET** | `VALIDATOR_STAKE_WEI` |
| VDR funded principal | **15,200 CNET** | `fundedDepositTotal()` (= 475 × 32) |
| Registered Guardian IPs (L0 DePIN) | **472** | `getAllNodes(start, 1)` last occupied index + 1 |
| Unique Guardian owner addresses | **472** | `getUniqueOwnerCount()` |
| Guardian regions | **7** | `getAllRegions()` |
| Treasury miner set | **4** addresses | `TreasuryBridgeV3.miners()` |
| Treasury execution quorum | **3** | `requiredVotes()` = `ceil(2N/3)` for N = 4 |
| Treasury owner | `0x87cAeD4e51C36a2C2ece3Aaf4ddaC9693d2405E1` | `owner()`; this address is also one of the four miners |

**Do not label `totalStakedValidatorCount() = 475` as “Staked L1 validators.”** That was the earlier error on this page.

`475` and `472` are close because they sit on the **same L0 / application scale**:

- **472** is the Guardian registry (L0 DePIN IPs / owners).
- **475** is the current `ValidatorDepositRedeem` ledger: records funded through this contract’s `fundAndDepositValidators`, including Guardian ↔ validator bind and beneficiary accounting for that path. The contract uses the count as a **principal reserve** (`32 × totalStakedValidatorCount` CNET).

Neither figure is the Prysm Beacon Chain active validator set. Consensus-layer indexes were already past **2000** on 2026-06-28 (block 169843). An issued index can belong to an exited validator, so **≥ 2000** is a lower bound on registry allocation, not a live headcount.

## VDR stake ledger (not the Beacon set)

`ValidatorDepositRedeem` at [`0xc71e246DD78B37C2fABc905D340932F28F503433`](https://mainnet.conet.network/address/0xc71e246DD78B37C2fABc905D340932F28F503433) is the UUPS proxy for **application-layer** validator deposits and Guardian beneficiary binding. The implementation is verified on the Explorer as `ValidatorDepositRedeem`.

`totalStakedValidatorCount()` increments only through this contract’s `fundAndDepositValidators` and decrements on `settleFullExitPayout`. It can therefore record:

- stake accounts completed through **this** VDR version;
- Guardian ↔ validator bind / beneficiary relationships managed here;
- a phase of deposits this contract custodied as the `0x01` withdrawal target.

It does **not** enumerate every key the Prysm Beacon validator registry has ever activated. Earlier or parallel consensus deposits that never passed this VDR path are invisible to that counter. That is why **475** can coexist with Beacon `validator_index` **2000**.

Protocol facts that can be checked without trusting this page:

```bash
RPC=https://rpc1.conet.network
VDR=0xc71e246DD78B37C2fABc905D340932F28F503433

cast call $VDR "totalStakedValidatorCount()(uint256)" --rpc-url $RPC
cast call $VDR "VALIDATOR_STAKE_WEI()(uint256)" --rpc-url $RPC
cast call $VDR "fundedDepositTotal()(uint256)" --rpc-url $RPC
```

Because every **VDR-counted** record uses the same 32 CNET unit, address-level stake **on this ledger** is uniform per record. Concentration, if it exists, is therefore an **operator- or key-control** question, not a “some VDR records posted 10,000 CNET and others posted 32 CNET” question. That statement does not size the Beacon active set.

The deposit-contract pointer on this proxy currently reads `0x4242424242424242424242424242424242424242`, the conventional consensus-layer deposit address used by the Prysm / Ethereum-style stack. That value identifies the consensus deposit path this VDR uses when it does deposit. It is not a CoNET application treasury, and it does not imply that every Beacon validator was funded here.

The Explorer’s generic `GET /api/v2/validators` route is **not available** for this chain type (`Endpoint not available for current chain type`). Block withdrawals remain a public CL signal: they carry `validator_index`. A per-pubkey CL-reward JSON exists at `https://beamio.app/api/v2/conet/validators/{pubkey}` for already-known BLS keys. Neither endpoint is a complete validator-set census.

## Guardian independence and geography

`GuardianNodesInfoV6` at [`0xBC6b53065b5647261396d002bDBA0d3396E0722f`](https://mainnet.conet.network/address/0xBC6b53065b5647261396d002bDBA0d3396E0722f) is verified on the Explorer. `addNode`, `removeNode`, and related mutations require `adminList`.

```bash
RPC=https://rpc1.conet.network
G=0xBC6b53065b5647261396d002bDBA0d3396E0722f

cast call $G "getUniqueOwnerCount()(uint256)" --rpc-url $RPC
cast call $G "getAllRegions()(string[])" --rpc-url $RPC
cast call $G "getRegionNodes(string)(string[])" "PA.US" --rpc-url $RPC
```

`getUniqueOwnerCount()` returns the length of the on-chain `_ownerList`. At the snapshot above, unique owners equal registered IPs (**472 = 472**). That is a strong **address-level** statement: the registry did not show multi-IP owners at that block. It is still a weak **operator-independence** statement. One person, company, or hosting account can control many addresses.

Region labels and IP counts at the same snapshot:

| Region label | Registered IPs | Share of 472 |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `PA.US` | 153 | 32.4% |
| `BW.DE` | 103 | 21.8% |
| `LND.GB` | 98 | 20.8% |
| `MD.ES` | 85 | 18.0% |
| `NW.DE` | 26 | 5.5% |
| `ND.US` | 4 | 0.8% |
| `NJ.US` | 3 | 0.6% |

The three largest labels (`PA.US`, `BW.DE`, `LND.GB`) held **354 / 472** IPs (**75.0%**). That is geographic concentration of **registry labels**, not a proven hosting or legal-entity concentration.

## Client diversity

Public evidence for the current L1 stack is a **single execution / consensus pair**:

| Layer | Documented client family |
| --- | --- |
| Execution | Geth |
| Consensus | Prysm `beacon-chain` |
| Validator client | Prysm `validator` |

Shared read-only beacon hosts in the current operations inventory run Geth 1.17.x with Prysm v7.1.x. That inventory is an operations fact, not a complete public validator census, and it does not introduce a second client family.

No Explorer API on this chain currently publishes a validator client-diversity breakdown. Until a second production EL/CL pair is documented and observed, **client diversity must be described as unpublished / single-family**, not as “diverse because many validator keys exist.”

## Governance

L1 has several control planes. They are not one committee.

### Guardian registry

- Admission and removal are `requireAddressInAdminlist`.
- The constructor sets `adminList[msg.sender] = true`.
- Later admins are added or removed by an existing admin (`changeAddressInAdminlist`).
- Registration is therefore **permissioned**, even though the resulting node list is publicly readable.

### Validator deposit / redeem

- The canonical address is an ERC-1967 proxy.
- Implementation upgrades use UUPS `_authorizeUpgrade` under the contract admin role.
- `addAdmin` / `removeAdmin` and redeem-admin roles are explicit privileged functions.
- VDR **record size** is a constant (32 CNET). VDR **membership** still depends on deposit, registration, and admin-gated bindings such as `registerNodeValidators`. That membership is not the Beacon validator registry.

### Cross-chain Treasury

[`TreasuryBridgeV3`](cross-chain-treasury.md) at `0xa208982212978550594A7FEEB70a61665d129003` uses an owner-managed miner list, not the 472 Guardian owners.

At the snapshot above:

- four miner addresses;
- quorum **3**;
- `owner()` equals the first miner.

That quorum governs Treasury policy and bridge operations. It does **not** vote L1 blocks. Do not present the 472 Guardian owners as the live Treasury voter set. The historical `ConetTreasury.requiredVotes` comment on `getUniqueOwnerCount` describes a deprecated treasury path.

### What is not published as L1 governance

- No token-weighted vote that seats or removes L1 validators.
- No public operator-domain registry on L1 equivalent to the DLE `OperatorDomainRegistryV1` specification.
- No published Nakamoto coefficient, hosting-provider table, or legal-entity map.

Those absences are part of the current public record. They should be stated, not filled with estimates.

## How to reproduce the snapshot

1. Confirm `chainId` **224422** on `https://rpc1.conet.network` (backup `https://publicrpc.conet.network`). Do not use deprecated `https://rpc.conet.network`.
2. Read the Explorer contract pages and confirm `is_verified` or `is_partially_verified` for the Guardian registry, the VDR proxy, and the VDR implementation.
3. Call the VDR views listed above. Compare `fundedDepositTotal / 32 ether` with `totalStakedValidatorCount` only as **VDR internal consistency**. Do not treat that quotient as the Beacon active-set size.
4. On the Explorer, open a block with withdrawals (example: [169843](https://mainnet.conet.network/block/169843)) and read `validator_index`. Indexes past 2000 refute any claim that L1 consensus has only ~475 validators.
5. Page `getAllNodes(start, 1)` until the first empty start index; that index is the **L0 Guardian** IP count.
6. Sum `getRegionNodes` lengths and confirm they equal the Guardian IP count.
7. Treat any failed RPC or Explorer response as **untrusted**. Do not overwrite a previous successful read with zero.
