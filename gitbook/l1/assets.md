# Assets

**Evidence level: Production reference.** Contract addresses identify current CoNET L1 assets; economic policy and upgrade authority require separate review.

This page identifies the principal assets referenced by CoNET L1 documentation. It is an asset map, not a tokenomics specification.

All assets below are associated with CoNET L1, **`chainId 224422`**.

| Asset | Type | Protocol use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CNET** | Native asset | Pays L1 gas and participates in protocol staking or bond mechanisms where a contract explicitly requires it |
| **conet-USDC** | Canonical ERC-20 | USD-denominated settlement and accounting asset used by CoNET contracts |
| **GBToken** (`GB`) | ERC-20, **9 decimals** | Active GB balance and transfer asset for DePIN service and bandwidth-related flows |

The Treasury controls explicit cross-chain route and canonical-asset policy. A foreign ERC-20 does not become canonical merely because it has been wrapped or assigned matching metadata. See [Decentralized cross-chain Treasury](cross-chain-treasury.md).

**ConetGB1155 is deprecated.** It is a legacy accounting track and must not be used as the canonical GB wallet balance, transfer asset, or default integration target. New integrations should use the GBToken ERC-20 contract and 9-decimal precision.

## Endpoint note

Read balances and token metadata from `https://rpc1.conet.network`, with `https://publicrpc.conet.network` as backup. `https://rpc.conet.network` is deprecated. The canonical Explorer is `https://mainnet.conet.network`.
